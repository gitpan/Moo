  - drop a couple of dependencies by minor releases we don't strictly need

    to fatpack Sub::Exporter for features we don't use
  - re-order is documentation to give readonly styles more prominence
  - a weakened value should still be returned on set (fixes lazy + weak_ref)

  - clarify how isa and coerce interact
  - support isa and coerce together for Moose

  - undefer all subs before creating a concrete Moose metaclass
  - fix bug in _load_module where global vars could cause mis-detection
    of the module already being loaded

0.009_017 - 2012-04-16
  - mangle constructor meta-method on inflation so make_immutable works

0.009_016 - 2012-04-12

0.009_015 - 2012-04-11
  - Complete support for MooseX::AttributeShortcuts 0.009
  - Allow Moo classes to compose Moose roles

    leakage fix into Role::Tiny's _load_module to provide partial parity

  - Remove Sub::Quote's outstanding queue since it doesn't actually slow
    things down to do it this way and makes debugging easier.

  - perl based getter dies if @_ > 1 (XSAccessor already did)

    subclasses with a BUILD method but no attributes get it honoured
  - add coerce handling

0.009008 - 2011-06-03
  - transfer fix to _load_module to Role::Tiny and make a note it's an inline
